### Problem

Create a display() method, to print the content of the linked list.

### Implementation

* The `LinkedList` class is defined, which represents a linked list data structure. It has a single instance variable head, which points to the first node of the 
   list.
  
* Create a `display()` method to print the contents of the linked list starting from the head node. It iterates through the list by following the next 
  references of each node and prints the data value.
  

```java

 static class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;
  Node(int d) {
  data = d;
  next = null;
        }
 }

public class LinkedList {
    Node head;

     static class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
        Node(int d) {
            data = d;
            next = null;
        }
    }
          /* your code here */

public static void main(String[] args) {
 LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
 list.head = new Node(100);
  Node second = new Node(200);
  Node third = new Node(300);
  list.head.next = second;
  second.next = third; 
    list.display();
    }
}
```
